# tank_battle
A 2d game where you drive a tank and battle a simple computer AI. I wrote this game in 2008. This is the oldest source code I still have.

This code was mostly written in 2008, but I think portions were from even earlier projects. When writing this I did not
understand how C++ files were linked so all the functions are implemented with their definitions. Unfortunately, this is
the oldest piece of code I can still find since I didnâ€™t really archive anything I wrote pre-2013. It was sheer luck
that I was able to dig this up from a decade old email.

So here it is, in all its original glory!
